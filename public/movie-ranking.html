<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>
I mean it speaks for itself.<br />
The MC, the villains, the side charcter, the storyline just perfect.<br />
 Top 3 animes of all time.<br />
</p>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>
Once again speaks for itself, part of the big 3.<br />
Aizen.<br />
Skip the fillers, aint nobody watching fillers in 2023.<br />
</p>
<h3>AOT</h3>
<p>
One message to the writer. You are a sick person.<br />
The way the storyline just changed, everything linking with one another.<br />
The characters: Eren, Levi, Mikasa, Erwin, Kenny.<br />
</p>
<h3>Blue Lock</h3>
<p>
Usually all sports anime only have one storyline, the MC is wack but then with the power of friendship, they win the tournament but blue lock changed that comletely.<br />
There is literally no bad episode, from episode 1 to current episode.<br />
The special moments are beautiful.<br />
</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>
    Quality of the anime is just beautiful.<br />
    A bit sad but that is what makes a quality anime.<br />
    Inokami Kagura, moments you will never expect and when they happen they are just beautiful.<br />
